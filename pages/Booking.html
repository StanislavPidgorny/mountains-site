          <p><strong>About the Trek</strong></p>
          <p>Friends, this Carpathian trek is almost all-inclusive with accommodation in comfortable cottages and daily hiking.
            We use private transfers for convenient transportation to the starting point of hiking trails.
            The difficulty of the peaks will gradually increase, and during the program we will climb incredibly beautiful and
            iconic peaks of the Carpathians: Hoverla, Homiak, and Shpytsi. <br>
            If you feel like resting, you can skip one of the walks and enjoy the landscapes directly from the cottages, as they
            are located near the forest.
            In addition to hiking, we will also explore the culture and traditions of the region. Believe me, it's very
            interesting!
            Evenings are spent fun and educational: with stories, board games, or watching mountain films on the projector.
            The trek is ideal for both first-time hikers and more experienced ones who love comfort and don't want to carry a
            heavy backpack.</p>

          <p><strong>About the Trek</strong></p>
          <p>Ascent to Hoverla is a 3-day adventure in the Carpathians. The program is not very difficult but extremely rich. In
            three days, we managed to fit a reasonable maximum. During this time, we will ascend to Hoverla (2061 m) and Petros
            (2020 m) - the most popular and one of the most beautiful peaks of the Ukrainian Carpathians. There are two options
            for the route: one slightly simpler - through Lazeshchyna, the other more interesting - starting in Kvasy (or
            Yasinya). <br>
            In the winter season, we conduct the program every weekend: Winter ascent to Hoverla and Petros - join us! <br>
            You will return home full of positive impressions, energized by the mountains and a little tired.</p>
